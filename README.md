# Lab report \#3 - instructions

Follow the instructions posted at
<https://ds202-at-isu.github.io/labs.html> for the lab assignment. The
work is meant to be finished during the lab time, but you have time
until Monday evening to polish things.

Include your answers in this document (Rmd file). Make sure that it
knits properly (into the md file). Upload both the Rmd and the md file
to your repository.

All submissions to the github repo will be automatically uploaded for
grading once the due date is passed. Submit a link to your repository on
Canvas (only one submission per team) to signal to the instructors that
you are done with your submission.

# Lab 3: Avenger’s Peril

## As a team

Extract from the data below two data sets in long form `deaths` and
`returns`

``` r
av <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/avengers/avengers.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(av)
```

Get the data into a format where the five columns for Death\[1-5\] are
replaced by two columns: Time, and Death. Time should be a number
between 1 and 5 (look into the function `parse_number`); Death is a
categorical variables with values “yes”, “no” and ““. Call the resulting
data set `deaths`.

Similarly, deal with the returns of characters.

``` r
# Transforming Return columns into long format
returns <- av %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("Return"), names_to = "Time", values_to = "Return") %>%
  mutate(Time = parse_number(Time), Return = replace_na(Return, ""))

    ## #   Death3 <chr>, Death4 <chr>, Death5 <chr>, Notes <chr>, Time <dbl>,
    ## #   Return <chr>

Based on these datasets calculate the average number of deaths an
Avenger suffers.

``` r
average_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(Death == "YES") %>%
  group_by(`Name.Alias`) %>%
  summarize(num_deaths = n()) %>%
  summarize(avg_deaths = mean(num_deaths))
average_deaths
```

    ##   avg_deaths
    ##        <dbl>
    ## 1       1.39

## Individually

For each team member, copy this part of the report.

Each team member picks one of the statements in the FiveThirtyEight
[analysis](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/avengers-death-comics-age-of-ultron/)
and fact checks it based on the data. Use dplyr functionality whenever
possible.

### Keenan Jacobs:

### FiveThirtyEight Statement

> “I counted 89 total deaths — some unlucky Avengers are basically Meat
> Loaf with an E-ZPass — and on 57 occasions the individual made a
> comeback.”

### Code to Fact-Check

``` r
# Counting total deaths
total_deaths <- deaths %>%
  filter(Death == "YES") %>%
  summarize(total_deaths = n())

# Counting total returns
total_returns <- returns %>%
  filter(Return == "YES") %>%
  summarize(total_returns = n())

# Display both totals
total_deaths
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total_deaths
    ##          <int>
    ## 1           89

``` r
total_returns
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 × 1
    ##   total_returns
    ##           <int>
    ## 1            57

### My Answer

The data confirms the statement from FiveThirtyEight regarding the
Avengers’ mortality and comebacks. We found exactly 89 deaths and 57
returns among the characters, aligning with the claim that “89 total
deaths” and “57 occasions the individual made a comeback.”
